## 📖 Why RSS is Better than APIs for News Apps

| RSS Feeds | Traditional APIs |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| Open and publicly available | Often require API keys and usage limits |
| Lightweight and fast | Can introduce additional overhead |
| No authentication needed | API rate limiting and quota restrictions |
| Flexible parsing for multiple sources | API responses are fixed and vendor-dependent |
| Consistent format (XML) | Varies across providers |

**→ RSS enables greater control, decentralization, and no dependency on third-party backend APIs.**  
This makes SD News more sustainable, faster, and simpler to maintain.
